  # selection probability (Note: The parameter value range is from 0 to 1)
  # Note ï¼šin the current version, the selection probability in the genetic algorithm is forced to be set to 0.5, so the parameter p_ The value of select does not affect the selection probability, but the value of the parameter int (100 * p-select) determines the setting of the selection scheme:
  # If the value of int (100 * p-select) is even, select the retained individuals based on their fitness level
  # If the value of int (100 * p-select) is a series, then the reserved individuals are selected through roulette wheel betting
  p_select: 0.5
